# Intro-to-Programming-II-Labs
My labs from EECS 162 written in C++

## Setup

Running these labs should be fairly straight forward, simply clone this repo and open the remote directory in your terminal.
Each of these projects should compile under g++.

Descriptions of each lab can be found within the file's comments.
